Analog verification is as much an art as a science (same for analog design).  As such, it takes a lot of manual effort and time to get right.  Digital design verification is easier sicne there are many tools that can synthensize circuits, enabling execution at hardware emulation speeds, and checking that certain assertions (ex. a bus ack will occur within n cycles of a bus req) defining proper circuit operatun.   Unfortunately, analog verification offers none of these benefits.

This repository contains the code that begins to address the technical challenges inherent in achieving these benefits.
